Unicode support for Font/Text (DONE, albeit a little buggy)

Figure submodule remaster (DONE)

Better Collision System
    Lots of heuristics before the real stuff kicks in

3D Support
    Cameras (Perspectives)
        with camera: ...

Text from stream (function(args) -> str)
    The text will only read the stream inbetween draw calls
    Perfect match for `getText()`
    Stream from file (?)

Better sprite Support
    The current one is really bad
    Animated sprites, etc.
    Migrate from SOIL to SpartanJ/SOIL2

Misc
    Eel.setFPS -> Locks FPS

    Functions for drawing class-based figures
        from inspect import signature
        locals[...] = ...
        keep one instance of that class buffered
